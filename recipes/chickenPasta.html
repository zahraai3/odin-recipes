    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This healthy chicken pasta recipe is jazzed up with traditional bruschetta toppers, including cherry tomatoes, garlic and basil. Multicolored cherry tomatoes look pretty, but you can use all one color of tomato too. Either way, you've got an easy weeknight dinner that's ready in 25 minutes. We've called for spaghettini (thin spaghetti) in this recipe, but feel free to use your favorite shape of pasta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <il>8 ounces whole-wheat spaghettini</il>
         <il>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</il>
          <il>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</il>
           <il>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</il>
            <il>2 pints multicolored cherry tomatoes</il>
             <il>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</il>
              <il>1 teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon ground pepper</il>
               <il>¼ cup cookcream and any favorites vegetables</il>
                <il>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon balsamic glaze</il>
                <il>1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated on smallest holes of box grater (about 1/4 cup)</il>
                <il>cup thinly sliced fresh basil</il>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <il>Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt. Drain and set aside.</il>
        <il>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large high-sided skillet over high heat. Add chicken and Italian seasoning; cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through and browned, about 6 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate. (Do not wipe the pan clean.)</il>
        <il>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add tomatoes, garlic, salt and pepper; cook, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits, until the tomatoes begin to burst, 4 to 5 minutes. Add cookcream and vegetables; increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes, pressing on the tomatoes as needed to crush them. Add the pasta and chicken; toss gently to combine. Divide the pasta mixture among 4 bowls. Drizzle evenly with balsamic glaze; sprinkle with Parmesan and basil.</il>
    </ol>
